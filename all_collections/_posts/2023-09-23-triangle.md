# How to calculate if a point is inside a triangle?

![Triangle ABC](/all_collections/images/triangle_abc_p.png)

So let's say you have an ABC triangle  with the following vertices:
 - A (Xa, Ya)
 - B (Xb, Yb)
 - C (Xc, Yc)


And you have a point in the coordinate:
 - P (Xp, Yp)

To verify if P is inside ABC you will need to:
 1. Calculate the area of the ABC triangle.
 2. Create 3 other triangles between each side of the ABC triangle with the point P. Example:
	- PAB
	- PAC
	- PBC
3. Calculate the area of each one.
4. If the sum of the area of the 3 triangles created from the sides of ABC and the point P are equal the area of ABC, then P is inside ABC.

## Calculating the area of ABC

The famous formula `A = (b * h) / 2` is used in plane geometry to calculate the area of a triangle. But today we are going to use the analytical geometry way to achive the same goal.

In analytical geometry the formula to calculate the area of a triangle is `A = 1/2 * |D|`
